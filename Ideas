# UI TODO:
# Minimum needed for fire: some kind of icon that shows if you currently are investing more or less than this
# Chosen coast fire: Some kind of icon that shows if the coast fire date you picked is feasible
# If current age or retirement age are not filled out (often on first visit), make it a nice experience: Maybe show the options page in this case? Make it obvious that current age and retirement age need to be filled out
# Make milestone table look nicer
# If "investing since", "monthly expenses after tax", "safe withdrawal rate" etc. are not filled out, the tool does not show a lot of data. Maybe show a warning about this? 
# In options panel, refuse to save or show warning if mandatory fields are missing.
# In options panel, show which fields are mandatory.
# Some better checks for the coasting date picker: Can I somehow limit it to be between current date and chosen retirement age?
# Somehow show that the percentages are in terms of TIME since investment start.
# If you've chosen a coast date, make it visible on the Month table when you are coasting. But, not just background-color: green..
# Figure out what to do when "investing since" is not filled out. Do we generate percentages based on numbers alone, and then switch to time-based when it is filled out? Or do we simply not generate any percentage data at all? 

# FEATURE IDEAS:
# Maybe a way to define multiple investments periods with different monthly contributions? 
# Make it possible to pick which milestones you want to see in the list
# Maybe view for advanced stats
# view for graph that dynamically lights up as you scroll down..?
# Show certain milestones graph, with net worth as function of months of investment
# Add option to track specific milestones? How can I make important milestones stand out? 
# Turn it into a whole page of various visualized investment things. Like, a graph showing "if you invested x every month from now, how much would you have compared to if you started y years ago? What if you had a principal of z in both scenarios? How much would somebody have to invest if they want to catch up to you in x years, and they started investing y years later than you?"

# BUGS:
# Option inputs: Make them behave nice. Tabbing in a currency field seems to save the vale with a separator in it. Changing a field with a separator is a bit wonky because the separators disappear when you make a change. 
# When did you start investing: If today is chosen (or nothing at all), the icons in the table are not generated properly.

# Stats TODO: 
# "Minimum monthly Contribution for FIRE" seems to be a little bit off. Maybe we're off by a month? It leaves us with a few months of coasting, for somer reason
# Make tooltips a bit better: They should have a proper icon, and should be easier to press on mobile.

# Questions
# Does it matter that I calculate interest monthly in the networthlist, and annually when using formulas?
# Utils future value formulas don't seem to give the same answer as the manual networthlist calculation
# In the FV formula, you can take into account that each consecutive payment of x value is worth less and less due to inflation, so that you see the result in "today's money" but with the monthly contributions losing value? But I guess I don't want this, and instead I just want everything to be inflation adjusted, assuming you invest 3%/12 extra every month? Should I write something about this?
