# Add "fake data" above current net worth, so that all the milestones are shown and you can see how far you have come. This will obviously not be accurate, but maybe allow a way to input how long it took you to reach your current net worth or something?
# Show milestones by color on graph, with net worth as function of months of investment
# Show percentage at each milestone: "How close are you to this milestone/net worth" in terms of time, not money
# Show approximate date that milestone will be reached, and how much time is left, and how old you will be
# Add a "line" in the chart that shows where you are, maybe color some cells differently
# Add milestones like "stop investing here and you will reach your fire number by age x/in x years"?
