# OPTIONS/STATS TODO:
# If current age or retirement age are not filled out (often on first visit), make it a nice experience: Maybe show the options page in this case? Make it obvious that current age and retirement age need to be filled out
# In options panel, refuse to save or show warning if mandatory fields are missing.
# In options panel, show which fields are mandatory.
# Coast Fire date: If you have picked a date, and later changed retirement age or current age so that the coast fire date no longer makes sense, then handle this gracefully. Maybe just reset coast fire date input if these are changed?
# If "investing since", "monthly expenses after tax", "safe withdrawal rate" etc. are not filled out, the tool does not show a lot of data. Maybe show a warning about this? 

# GENERAL UI TODO:
# Make milestone table look nicer
# Somehow show that the percentages are in terms of TIME since investment start.
# If you've chosen a coast date, make it visible on the Month table when you are coasting. But, not just background-color: green..
# Figure out what to do when "investing since" is not filled out. Do we generate percentages based on numbers alone, and then switch to time-based when it is filled out? Or do we simply not generate any percentage data at all? 
# Move the scroll bar to the right of the screen

# BUGS:
# Option inputs: Make them behave nice. Tabbing in a currency field seems to save the vale with a separator in it. Changing a field with a separator is a bit wonky because the separators disappear when you make a change. 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FEATURE IDEAS:
# Maybe a way to define multiple investments periods with different monthly contributions? 
# Make it possible to pick which milestones you want to see in the list
# Maybe view for advanced stats
# view for graph that dynamically lights up as you scroll down..?
# Show certain milestones graph, with net worth as function of months of investment
# Add option to track specific milestones? How can I make important milestones stand out? 
# Turn it into a whole page of various visualized investment things. Like, a graph showing "if you invested x every month from now, how much would you have compared to if you started y years ago? What if you had a principal of z in both scenarios? How much would somebody have to invest if they want to catch up to you in x years, and they started investing y years later than you?"


# Questions
# Does it matter that I calculate interest monthly in the networthlist, and annually when using formulas?
# Utils future value formulas don't seem to give the same answer as the manual networthlist calculation
# In the FV formula, you can take into account that each consecutive payment of x value is worth less and less due to inflation, so that you see the result in "today's money" but with the monthly contributions losing value? But I guess I don't want this, and instead I just want everything to be inflation adjusted, assuming you invest 3%/12 extra every month? Should I write something about this?
