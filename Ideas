# Show milestones by color on graph, with net worth as function of months of investment
# Show percentage at each milestone: "How close are you to this milestone/net worth" in terms of time, not money
# Show approximate date that milestone will be reached, and how much time is left, and how old you will be
# Add milestones like "stop investing here and you will reach your fire number by age x/in x years"?
# Maybe a big wheel showing percentage of fire?
# Options menu for inputs.
# Options for different data views?
# Add option for how many months ago you started investing, which is then used to scale the simulated past data accordingly. This should also automatically make the percentages (x% of this goal reached, etc.) correct.
# Add option to track specific milestones? How can I make important milestones stand out?
