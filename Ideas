# NEW MILESTONES
# - None at the moment

# LONG TERM IDEAS
# Show certain milestones graph, with net worth as function of months of investment
# Somehow be able to scroll through future months and see the page update?
# Add option to track specific milestones? How can I make important milestones stand out? 
# Turn it into a whole page of various visualized investment things. Like, a graph showing "if you invested x every month from now, how much would you have compared to if you started y years ago? What if you had a principal of z in both scenarios? How much would somebody have to invest if they want to catch up to you in x years, and they started investing y years later than you?"

# Other TODO:
# When deleting from currency input, put cursor back where it was before.
# Maybe view for advanced stats, view for graph that dynamically lights up as you scroll down..?
# tooltip buttons to make things easier to understand
# Make milestone table look nicer
# Some better checks for the coasting date picker: Do I want to limit the date from it? How to handle if it's before current date? etc.
# Maybe a way to define multiple investments periods with different monthly contributions? 
# Make it possible to pick which milestones you want to see in the list
# If current age or retirement age are not filled out (often on first visit), make it a nice experience: Maybe show the options page in this case? Save the menu in local storage? 
# Make it obvious that current age and retirement age need to be filled out
# Coast from date should check that it's between current date and retirement date


# Stats TODO: 
# Minimum needed for fire: some kind of icon that shows if you invest more or less than this
# "Minimum monthly Contribution for FIRE" seems to be a little bit off. Maybe we're off by a month? It leaves us with a few months of coasting, for somer eason
# Minimum monthly Contribution for FIRE: if Months of contribution is 0 and fire cannot be reached, put N/A?

# TOOLTIPS:
# Retirement Age
# - When you want to retire. Your investments are simulated until this date. The tool will say whether coast fire or fire are possible given this timeframe and your other selected options.
# - Some info about the fact that it's important to pick an investment start date and invest steadily. The FIRE and Coast FIRE percentage circles cannot calculate how far along you are if you started investing this month, or invest different amounts
# "Minimum monthly Contribution for FIRE" takes into account the chosen coast fire date.


# Questions
# Does it matter that I calculate interest monthly in the networthlist, and annually when using formulas?
# Utils future value formulas don't seem to give the same answer as the manual networthlist calculation
# In the FV formula, you can take into account that each consecutive payment of x value is worth less and less due to inflation, so that you see the result in "today's money" but with the monthly contributions losing value? But I guess I don't want this, and instead I just want everything to be inflation adjusted, assuming you invest 3%/12 extra every month? Should I write something about this?
