# NEW MILESTONES

# LONG TERM IDEAS
# Show certain milestones graph, with net worth as function of months of investment
# Somehow be able to scroll through future months and see the page update?
# Add option to track specific milestones? How can I make important milestones stand out? 
# Turn it into a whole page of various visualized investment things. Like, a graph showing "if you invested x every month from now, how much would you have compared to if you started y years ago? What if you had a principal of z in both scenarios? How much would somebody have to invest if they want to catch up to you in x years, and they started investing y years later than you?"

# TODO:
# Improved menu, maybe hamburger button and title bar? Maybe view for advanced stats, view for graph that dynamically lights up as you scroll down..?
# Save options in cookies/local storage
# tooltip buttons to make things easier to understand
# Make milestone table look nicer
# Starting to wonder if it makes sense to have a class/object for each month instead of just number[]. 
# Stats: 
# - Estimated net worth at retirement
# - coasting from
# Current FIRE and Coast Fire numbers are generated based on estimated growth. If you pick that you want to coast from x date, the "coast from" stat feels a bit redundant..?
# Label and text: Optional 2nd line of text
# "Time from now" in table is broken - showing the same months multiple times in a row
# Some better checks for the coasting date picker: Do I want to limit the date from it? How to handle if it's before current date? etc.
