# NEW MILESTONES
# - "stop investing here and you will reach your fire number by age x/in x years"?
# - x years until Coast FIRE
# - x years until FIRE

# LONG TERM IDEAS
# Show certain milestones graph, with net worth as function of months of investment
# Somehow be able to scroll through future months and see the page update?
# Add option to track specific milestones? How can I make important milestones stand out? 
# Turn it into a whole page of various visualized investment things. Like, a graph showing "if you invested x every month from now, how much would you have compared to if you started y years ago? What if you had a principal of z in both scenarios? How much would somebody have to invest if they want to catch up to you in x years, and they started investing y years later than you?"

# TODO:
# Some milestones seem to disappear when you change your monthly contributions - range/generator function?
# Save options in cookies/local storage
# tooltip buttons to make things easier to understand
# Make milestone table look nicer
# Option for "coasting from x month", which sets your monthly contribution to 0 from that month onward,
